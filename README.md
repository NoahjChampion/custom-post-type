# custom-post-type
A base class for WordPress custom post types

I have seen quite a few different ways of how people handle custom post types in wordpress, but was never really happy with any of them.  They all did what they were designed to, but never really seemed to cover every thing that I needed.  So I set out to make my own.  It is still very much a work in progress.  Please drop me a note if you find it useful in your own projects.
